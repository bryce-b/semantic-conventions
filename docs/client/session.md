# Semantic conventions for session
This document defines semantic conventions to apply to client-side applications when tracking sessions.

A session is collection of Logs, Events, and Spans associated with a specific device or user within a specific period of time. 
A session is represented by a unique identifier that is attached to Logs, Events, and Spans as an attribute.

The primary purpose of sessions is to provide insight into the series of user actions or events that lead a critical or 
interesting occurrence in the application's use. Sessions also provide a means to quantify overall application usage.


## Attributes

This attribute can be applied to all signals generated by an agent. It may be omitted from metrics, due to their aggregated nature. 

| Attribute   | Type    | Description | Examples                             | Requirement level | 
|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| session.id  |  String | A GUID      | 00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff | required          |

## How a session operates
After a period of timeout, the `session.id` MUST be refreshed.
The timeout period MUST be restarted when any Logs, Events, or Spans are recorded.
The session timeout period CAN be customized.
Default session timeout SHOULD be 30 minutes. Session timeout period SHOULD be established when the instrumentation is first configured and MUST NOT be updated in the middle of a session. 
Maximum session length SHOULD NOT exceed 4 hours.
